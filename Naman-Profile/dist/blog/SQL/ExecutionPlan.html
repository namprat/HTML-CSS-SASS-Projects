                </h1>

                <p>Audience : Beginner </p>

                <p>Purpose of writing a blog is give you GOLD in a short time. Idea is to write straight to the point,
                    and
                    not
                    circle around to make my blog bigger and monotonous.
                </p>

                <p> <span>Optimizer</span> - A piece of software that models the way in which database relational engine
                    works.
                    Fuel
                    of optimizer
                    are statistics which sql server generates and maintains against indexes and columns.

                </p>

                <p>
                    The optimizer figures out how best to implement the request represented to T-SQL query you
                    submitted. It
                    decides
                    if it can access the data through indexes, what types of join to use and much more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span>Statistics</span> are collected on columns and indexes within the database and describe the
                    data
                    distribution and the
                    uniqueness, or the selectivity of the data. We don’t want the optimizer to read all the data in all
                    the
                    tables
                    referenced in a query each time it tries to generate a plan, so it relies on statistics, a sample of
                    data
                    that
                    provides a construct of data used by the optimizer to represent the entire collection.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Estimated and Actual Execution Plan - Estimated plan is a plan which represents output of an
                    optimizer.
                    The
                    steps within the plan are logical steps, because they are representative of the optimizer's view of
                    the
                    plan
                    and
                    don’t represent what actually occurs when the query runs.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Whereas, Actual plan represents the output from the actual query execution. It shows data
                    representing
                    what
                    happened when the query was executed.

                    Estimated plans are stored in the plan cache, so accessing the data available in actual execution
                    plan
                    only
                    happens by capturing execution of query

                </p>

                <h4>Interpreting graphical execution plan
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Each operator has a <span>logical and a physical component</span> . They are frequently the same,
                    but
                    when
                    looking at
                    estimated plan, you are only seeing logical operators. When looking at an actual plan, you are only
                    seeing
                    physical operators, laid out in the logical processing order in which SQL server will retrieve the
                    information
                    defined by the query. This means, that we read the plans from the left to the right.

                    However, you’re going to find that you will generally read the execution plan the other direction,
                    going
                    from
                    right to left. This is not because the execution plans are laid out incorrectly. It’s because the
                    physical
                    order
                    of operation is frequently easier to understand than the logical order of operations.

                </p>

                <p>
                    You will note that there is an arrow pointing between the two icons in execution plan. This arrow
                    represents
                    the
                    data passed between the operators, as represented by icons. The thickness of the arrow reflects the
                    amount
                    of
                    data passed, the thicker arrow means more rows.

                    Each of the icons and arrows has a pop-up window called a tooltip which you can access by hovering
                    your
                    mouse
                    pointer over the icon.

                </p>

                <p>Common Tooltip of select operators</p>
                <p>
                    Here you get the numbers generated by the optimizer on the following
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Cached plan size - How much memory the plan generated by this query will take up in the plan
                            cache. This is a
                            useful number when investigating cache performance issue because you wil be abkle to see
                            which
                            plans are taking
                            up more memory
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Degree of parallelism - Whether this plan used multiple processor. This plan uses a single
                            processor
                            as
                            shown by
                            the value of 1
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Estimated operator cost - This is a percentage cost
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Estimated subtree cost - Tells us the accumulated optimizer cost assigned to this step and
                            all
                            previous
                            steps,
                            but remember to read from right to left. This number is meaningless in the real world, but
                            is a
                            mathematical
                            evaluation used by the query optimizer to determine the cost of the operator in question
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Estimated number of rows - Calculated based on statistics available to the optimizer for the
                            table
                            or
                            index in
                            question

                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <p>
                    First are listed the physical operation and logical operation. The logical operation are the result
                    of
                    the
                    optimizer’s calculations for what should happen when the query executes. The physical operators
                    represents
                    what
                    actually occurred. The logical and physical operators are usually the same.

                </p>

                <p>
                    After that we see estimated costs of the I/O, CPU, operators and subtree. Just like in the previous
                    Tooltip,
                    the
                    subtree cost is simply the section of execution tree that we have looked at so far, working again
                    from
                    right
                    to
                    left, and top to bottom. SQL Server bases all the estimations on the statistics available on the
                    columns
                    and
                    indexes in any table.

                </p>

                <p>
                    The I/0 cost and CPU cost are not actual values, but rather the estimated cost numbers assigned by
                    the
                    query
                    optimizer during its calculations. These numbers can be useful when considering whether most of the
                    estimated
                    cost is I/O based or if we’re potentially putting a load on the CPU.

                </p>

                <p>
                    You will note that the operator cost and subtree cost are the same, since the table scan is the only
                    significant
                    operator, in terms of the work done to execute the query. For more complex trees, with more
                    operators,
                    you
                    will
                    see that the subtree cost accumulates as the individual cost for each operator is added to the
                    total.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Estimated number of rows - The plan displays this number for each operation because each operation
                    is
                    dealing
                    with different sets of data. When you get to execution plans that are more complicated, we will see
                    the
                    number
                    of rows change as various operators perform their work on the data as it passes between each
                    operator.

                </p>
                <p> Another important piece of information, when troubleshooting performance issue, is the boolean value
                    displayed
                    for
                    the ordered. This tell us whether the data that this operator is working with is in an ordered
                    state.
                    Certain
                    operation, for example an ORDER BY CLAUSE IN A SELECT statement may require data to be in a
                    particular
                    order,
                    sorted
                    by a particular value. Knowing whether data is in an order state helps show where the extra
                    processing
                    may
                    be
                    occuring to get the data into that state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly Node ID is the ordinal, which simply means numbered in the order of the node itself. When the
                    optimizer
                    generates a plan, it numbers the operation in the logical order of the operations.

                </p>
                <p>
                    All these details are available to help us understand what’s happening within the query in question.
                    We
                    can
                    walk
                    through the various operators observing how the subtree cost accumulates, how the number of rows
                    changes
                    and
                    so
                    on. With these details, we can identify queries that are using an excessive amount of CPU or tables
                    that
                    need
                    more indexes, or identify other performance issues.

                <p>
                    Before you fix any issue or solve a problem, you need to identify the cause of it. This is one of
                    the
                    most
                    popular topics amongst developers for SQL tuning. I have written down important areas to look for
                    when
                    diagnosing performance issues related to execution plans. This is the most discussed topic on the
                    internet
                    and you need to have in depth understanding of various components involved in optimizing complex
                    stored
                    procedures.
                </p>
                <p>Generally speaking, there can be various reasons for slowness such as deadlock, bad index design,
                    table
                    scan,
                    out of data statistics, execution plan selected by the optimizer isn’t good enough (optimizer timed
                    out
                    when
                    generating optimized plan), CPU pressure, IO issue.
                </p>
                <p> I would personally follow below steps in order </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Look for Parameter sniffing - Since It’s one of the common issues with regressive queries,
                            and
                            it’s
                            quick to identify, that’s why it’s mostly my first step. For someone who don’t know
                            parameter
                            sniffing, explaining parameter sniffing in 2-3 sentences, though it is a topic worth writing
                            few
                            paragraphs.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If an optimizer generates different execution plans for two different input on
                            recompilation,
                            then
                            the query which executes first, registers its plan in cache, and when running the query with
                            different input parameters, optimizer skips the process of generating optimized plan and
                            takes
                            the
                            one stored in cache, even though it’s the suboptimal one.

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Find out when the query experienced slowness and if this slowness happened because of
                            deadlock
                            inside
                            the database. You can use DMOs sys.dm_exec_sessions, sys.dm_exec_requests,

                            to
                            figure out what session, query is causing deadlock to happen, and what other queries are
                            affected by
                            it.

                    </li>

                            Each node in an execution plan shows its relative estimated cost in the complete execution
                            plan,
                            with the total cost of the whole plan being 100 percent. Therefore, focus attention on the
                            nodes
                            with the highest relative cost.

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Execution plan may be from a batch of statements, so you may also need to find the most
                            costly
                            estimated statement. In a batch statement, there will be multiple plans, and they will be
                            numbered
                            in the order they occurred within the batch.

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Quickly scan thickness of the connecting arrows between nodes. A thick connecting arrows
                            indicate a
                            large number of rows being transferred between the corresponding nodes. Analyze the node to
                            the
                            left
                            of the arrow to understand why it requires so many rows.


                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Check the property of the arrows too. You may see that the estimated rows and the actual
                            rows
                            are
                            different. This can be caused by out of data statistics, amongst other things. If you see
                            thick
                            arrows
                            through much of the plan and then a thin arrow at the end, it might be possible to modify
                            the
                            query
                            or
                            indexes to get the filtered done earlier in the plan
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            When examining an execution plan, look out for hash join operations. For small result sets,
                            a
                            nested
                            loop join a usually the preferred join example. Hash join are not necessarily bad, and loop
                            joins
                            are
                            not necessarily good. It depends on the amount of data being returned by the query

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            There may be warnings, indicated by an exclamation point on one of the operators, which are
                            the
                            areas
                            of immediate concern. These can be caused by a variety of issues including a join without
                            join
                            criteria or an index or a table with missing statistics. Usually resolving the warning
                            situation
                            will
                            help performance.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Look for key lookup operations. A lookup operation for a large result set can cause a large
                            number
                            of random reads.

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Very important to look for sort operation. This indicates that the data was not retrieved in
                            the
                            correct sort order. Again, this may be an issue, but it is an indicator of potential
                            problems,
                            possibly a missing or incorrect index. Ensuring that the data is sorted in a specified
                            manner
                            using
                            ORDER BY is not problematic, but sort can lead to reduced performance
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Watch for operators that may be placing additional load on the system such as table spools.
                            They
                            may
                            be necessary for operation of the query, or they may indicate an improperly written query or
                            badly
                            designed indexes.
